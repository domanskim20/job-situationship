# 💃 Moves That Match the Mood

Here’s where the feelings go full video.  
TikToks, Reels, dance breaks, lip-sync POVs — if it’s cinematic and job-search inspired, it belongs here.

## 🎥 What to share:
- Lip syncs to breakup songs
- Dance moves after a rejection email, a job offer, any work feels.
- POVs: “Me preparing for the 4th interview round knowing they’ll ghost me again”
- “Pick me” energy reenactments (but make it fun)
- Your job situationship feels.
