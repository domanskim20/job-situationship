# 🎬 Story Behind This Repo

This all started as a fun side project to make learning creative content fun — with a little help from memes, markdown, and main character energy.  

Exploring and curious on how the world of professional “situationships" is —, the “we’re not officially anything, but I still show up and give 110%” kind of vibes.  

Think of this as your romcom universe for work-related storytelling.
