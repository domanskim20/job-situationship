## 📖 Project Overview

This repo started as a romcom-style story about work feels and the emotional chaos of working life.  
But it's also an experiment in content creation, digital community building, and documenting a creative journey — like a mini product in the wild.

Whether you're job searching, stuck in a “work situationship,” or just here for the memes — welcome.
