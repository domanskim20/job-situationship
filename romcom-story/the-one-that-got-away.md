## 💔 The One That Got Away

At this point, my job search feels less like a romcom montage...  
and more like a season of *The Bachelor* no one asked for. 🌹😂

I’m out here — showing up polished, prepared, genuinely excited.

There are so many great prospects on paper:  
Smart. Successful. Wildly attractive (you know, in a career growth kind of way).

But then...

Some completely ghost me after a magical first meeting.  
Some play hard to get — one minute they're interested, next minute... crickets.  
Some leave me reading signals like I'm decoding ancient runes. 🧐📜

And don’t even get me started on the almost-perfect ones —  
We had all the chemistry, but the timing was wrong, and the location?  
Well, it’s just too far to make it work.  
*(Like… who wants to do a long-distance relationship with a job?) 🛫*

Meanwhile, my family and friends keep cheering me on:  
> *“You’re a total catch. They don’t know what they’re missing!”*

And they’re right.

Because somewhere out there is the right fit —  
The one who shows up, stays consistent, and says,  
> *“You’re exactly what we’ve been looking for.”*

And when that happens, you better believe I’ll say:

> "I do." 📝💛

And if not?

Well, honey...
If this isn’t our story —
> I know the next one will be even better. ✨
